# Expedition Quest Creator Help

## Getting Started

The first time you open the [quest creator](http://quests.expeditionrpg.com), it will populate itself with a "Getting Started" quest that walks you through the basics of creating Expedition quests.

If you're looking for more specific, in-detail documentation, check out:
* [QDL Guide](qdl_guide.md): More details on the Quest Design Language.
* [XML Spec](quest_spec.md): The underlying XML used by the app, in great detail.

## Where are my quests?

Your quests are saved in your Google Drive with a `.quest` extension. To open a quest, go to your Google Drive, right click on the quest, and select `Open with -> Expedition Quest Creator`

## I have an error, now what?

* [here's how to file an error report](internal_error.md)
* as we add documentation on other errors, their links will appear here and in the quest creator

## Other helpful resources

* A [fantastic video](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1023346/Choice-Consequence-and) that covers designing meaningful and fulfilling decision design in quests.
