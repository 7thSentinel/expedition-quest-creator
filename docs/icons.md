# Expedition Quest Creator Icons

You can insert inline icons into your quest using `[icon_name]`. Inline icons are currently supported in roleplaying cards, instruction elements and in the titles of choices.

We recommend only using icons as unique symbols, not as a replacement for words. (i.e. **DON'T:** use the dice icon instead of saying "roll a dice". **DO:** use the bandit icon to show what the thief's tatoo looks like)

At this time, you can use the following Expedition icons:

* d20
* adventurer
* bandit
* beast
* cards
* damage
* fae
* helper
* hp
* loot
* magic
* melee
* music
* ranged
* roll (same as d20)
* target
* undead
